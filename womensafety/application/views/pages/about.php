          <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p>Women’s safety involves safe spaces. Space is not neutral. Space which causes
          fear restricts movement and thus the community’s use of the space. Lack of
          movement and comfort is a form of social exclusion. Conversely, space can
          also create a sensation of safety and comfort, and can serve to discourage
          violence. Therefore planning and policy around safety should always involve
          and consider women.

              The rapid urbanization taking place the world over has opened up a
              whole new chapter of research, drawing linkages between political
              economy, social relations, safety and communities. Alongside this wave
              of modernization that is sweeping the cities, there is an undercurrent of
              a deepening sense of isolation and increasing vulnerability of sections of
              society that have traditionally been at a disadvantage because of their
              gender, class, migrant status, age or sexual orientation. This vulnerability
              is manifest, most importantly, in the manner in which these groups
              are denied or are unable to access what the city has to offer, thereby
              affecting their quality of life in ways that compel them to negotiate
              their movements across the city even as they face pressures of all kinds.
              Among the many axes of discrimination and exclusion, gender occupies a
              central position. There are many factors that play a role in determining
              women’s access to the city. The safety of women and gender inclusive
              cities are broad concepts, but for this study the focus will be on the
              ability of women to participate in the life in the city, to study, to work
              and move around, and more specifically to address the violence that
              women and girls face in the process of carrying out their daily activities.

Even in nations that have laws to protect women, what’s on the books may differ widely from what’s enforced.

            <h4>Discriminatory Norms</h4>
            <p>
              Nearly 75 percent of men in Pakistan believe it is unacceptable for women to have a paid job. Disapproval exceeds 50 percent in Bangladesh, Yemen, Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan.

              Women are at risk of violence both in public and private spheres, in and around the home, in neighbourhoods and at city level. Risk is infl uenced by urban design choices and the organisation of public services including transport and energy, amongst other things. Women experience a higher degree of insecurity which can restrict their access and use of the city. UN-HABITAT supports sustainability and inclusiveness in our cities.But women and girls still experience a higher degree of insecurity as compared to men and boys, which limits their access to city services.
